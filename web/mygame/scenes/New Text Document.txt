They say that when Heaven and Hell seperated war broke out. They say the Devil scorned God and all he stood for, cursing his very being all the way down to Hell itself. They say that the angels soon to follow commited grevious sins that none could gorgive. That the Seven sins were the most powerful of all demons to come from Hell.
